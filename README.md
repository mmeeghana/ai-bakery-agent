## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps in **Google Cloud Shell** to provision the demo environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmeeghana/ai-bakery-agent.git
cd ai-bakery-agent
```

### 2. Authenticate with Google Cloud

Run the following command to authenticate with your Google Cloud account. This is required for the ADK to access BigQuery.

```bash
gcloud config set project [YOUR-PROJECT-ID]
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Run the environment setup script. This script will:
*   Enable necessary Google Cloud APIs (Maps, BigQuery, remote MCP).
*   Create a restricted Google Maps Platform API Key.
*   Create a `.env` file with required environment variables.

```bash
chmod +x setup/setup_env.sh
./setup/setup_env.sh
```

### 4. Provision BigQuery

Run the setup script. This script automates the following:
*   Creates a Cloud Storage bucket.
*   Uploads the CSV data files.
*   Creates the `mcp_bakery` BigQuery dataset.
*   Loads the data into BigQuery tables.

```bash
chmod +x ./setup/setup_bigquery.sh
./setup/setup_bigquery.sh
```

### 5. Install ADK and Run Agent

Create a virtual environment, install the ADK, and run the agent.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# If the above fails, you may need to install python3-venv:
# apt update && apt install python3-venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install ADK
pip install google-adk==1.28.0

# Navigate to the app directory
cd adk_agent/

# Run the ADK web interface
adk web --allow_origins 'regex:https://.*\.cloudshell\.dev'
```


### 6. Chat with the Agent

Open the link provided by `adk web` in your browser. You can now chat with the agent and ask it questions about the bakery data.

**Sample Questions:**

*   "I’m looking to open my fourth bakery location in Los Angeles. I need a neighborhood with early activity. Find the zip code with the highest 'morning' foot traffic score."
*   "Can you search for 'Bakeries' in that zip code to see if it's saturated? If there are too many, check for 'Specialty Coffee' shops, so I can position myself near them to capture foot traffic."
*    "Okay and I want to position this as a premium brand. What is the maximum price being charged for a 'Sourdough Loaf' in the LA Metro area?"
*    "Now I want a revenue projection for December 2025. Look at my sales history and take data from my best performing store for the 'Sourdough Loaf'. Run a forecast for December 2025 to estimate the quantity I'll sell. Then, calculate the projected total revenue using just under the premium price we found (let's use $18)"
*    "That'll cover my rent. Lastly, let's verify logistics. Find the closest "Restaurant Depot" to the proposed area and make sure that drive time is under 30 minutes for daily restocking."

To abort the ADK session in Cloud Shell, press `Ctrl+C`.

### 7. Cleanup

To avoid incurring ongoing costs for BigQuery storage or other Google Cloud resources, you can run the cleanup script. This script will delete the BigQuery dataset, the Cloud Storage bucket, and the API keys created during setup. Navigate back to the root directory of the repository and run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x cleanup/cleanup_env.sh
./cleanup/cleanup_env.sh
```

## Cloud Run Deployment
This project is deployed using Google Cloud Run.

Deployment command:
```bash
gcloud run deploy bakery-agent \
--source . \
--region asia-south1 \
--allow-unauthenticated
```
